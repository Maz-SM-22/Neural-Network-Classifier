# Neural-Network-Classifier
Simple Yes/No neural network classifier for heart disease

In this project, I have attempted to tackle a neural network and build a simple binary classfication model for heaart disease. It was based on this <a href="https://github.com/pyladies-bcn/your_first_neural_network/blob/master/DIY%20your%20first%20Neural%20Network.ipynb"> DIY neural network project</a> from pyladies-bcn. 

I have changed the project by using a different dataset from Kaggle about heart disease, which I have included in this repository. 

This notebook looks at: 
* Data exploration and preprocessing 
* Building, compiling and training a neural network 
* Evaluating the results of the classifier model
